<h1>Advanced kana</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Basic kana characters can be modified in various ways.</p>
<h4>Sound modification</h4>
<p>By adding a dakuten marker ( ゛), a voiceless consonant is
turned into a voiced consonant: k→g, ts/s→z, t→d, h→b and ch/sh→j.</p>
<p>For example, か (ka) becomes が (ga).
Kana beginning with an h can also add a handakuten marker ( ゜) changing the h to a p.
For example, は (ha) becomes ぱ (pa).</p>

<h4>Substitution</h4>
<p>A small version of the hiragana for ya, yu or yo (ゃ, ゅ or ょ respectively)
may be added to hiragana ending in i.</p>
<p>This changes the i vowel sound to a glide (palatalization) to a, u or o.
For example, き (ki) plus ゃ (small ya) becomes きゃ (kya).
Addition of the small y kana is called yōon.</p>

<h4>Doubled consonant</h4>
<p>A small tsu っ, called a sokuon, indicates that the
following consonant is geminated (doubled).</p>
<p>In Japanese this is an important distinction in pronunciation;
for example, compare さか saka "hill" with さっか sakka "author".</p>
<p>However, it cannot be used to double the na, ni, nu, ne, no syllables' consonants – to double
these, the singular n (ん) is added in front of the syllable, as in みんな (minna, "all").</p>
