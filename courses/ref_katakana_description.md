<h1>Katakana of 46 base characters</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The word katakana means "fragmentary kana" as the katakana characters are derived from
components of more complex kanji. Katakana and hiragana are both kana systems.</p>
<p>In contrast to the hiragana syllabary, which is used for those Japanese language 
words and grammatical inflections which kanji does not cover, the katakana syllabary usage 
is quite similar to italics in English; specifically, it is used for transcription of 
foreign language words into Japanese and the writing of loan words (collectively gairaigo); 
for emphasis; to represent onomatopoeia; for technical and scientific terms; and for 
names of plants, animals, minerals, and often Japanese companies.</p>
<p>Katakana are characterized by short, straight strokes and sharp corners, 
and are the simplest of the Japanese scripts.</p>
