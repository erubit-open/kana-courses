<h1>Hiragana of 46 base characters</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hiragana is a phonetic lettering system.
The word hiragana literally means "ordinary" or "simple" kana.
It is a Japanese syllabary, one component of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana, kanji, 
and in some cases rōmaji.</p>
<p>Hiragana and katakana are both kana systems. With one or two minor exceptions, 
each sound in the Japanese language (mora) is represented by one character in each system. 
This may be either a vowel such as "a" (あ); a consonant followed by a vowel such as "ka"
(か); or "n" (ん), a nasal sonorant.</p>
<p>Hiragana is used to write okurigana, kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to 
inflect verbs and adjectives, various grammatical and function words including particles, 
as well as miscellaneous other native words for which there are no kanji or whose kanji form 
is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose. Words that do have common kanji renditions 
may also sometimes be written instead in hiragana, according to an individual author's preference.</p>
<p>Hiragana is also used to write furigana, a reading aid that shows the pronunciation
of kanji characters.</p>
